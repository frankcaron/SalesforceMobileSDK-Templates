# Salesforce Mobile SDK - LWC Flow Example

This repository contains a working build artifact of a Hybrid Remote mobile app built with the new Lightning Web Component embed technique to leverage LWC in the context of the Mobile SDK. In particular, this example has been built to show how a Lightning Flow can be embedded in a mobile app via the SDK.

This is super useful for customers who may be heavily using Flow and Lightning Web Components in the context of Community Cloud but who want to extend that investment to their wholly-owned native or hybrid Mobile apps by leveraging the Mobile SDK.
